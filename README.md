This project is an end-to-end pipeline that uses AWS SageMaker, S3, 
and Lambda to train and deploy a machine learning model for cryptocurrency price monitoring.  
It stores and processes crypto data, builds a predictive model,
and integrates AWS Lambda to send real-time alerts when price thresholds are crossed.
